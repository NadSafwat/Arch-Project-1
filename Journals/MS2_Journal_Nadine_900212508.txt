Important Note: We worked together continuously on Friday and Saturday to finish the project, therefore, we’ve done the same things together.




Thursday:
November 2, 11:00 pm: 
* Created a decompressor for milestone 3, but not tested yet.


Friday:
November 3, 3:00 pm:
* Edited the CU and ALU CU to include all instructions for the data types we had from the lab (RISB)
November 3, 4:40 pm:
* Edited the ALU to include all operations needed for all instructions 
* Edited the memories to be byte addressable instead of word addressable
November 3, 5:55 pm:
* Created the Branch control unit and created the case statement that would carry out the needed flag comparison
* Edited data memory reading and writing to accommodate the different load and store instructions
November 3, 9:15 pm:
* Edited the CU and the ALUCU as well as some aspects of the top module (Processor) to accommodate for JAL, JALR, LUI, AUIPC, EBREAK, ECALL, FENCE, FENCE.I


Saturday:
November 4, 12:00 am: 
* Drew full datapath on draw.io.
November 4, 1:30 pm:
* Ran the project on Vivado to check for syntax errors and fixed them.
November 4, 2:30 pm:
* Ran the first test (Lab test) to see that original path was still working
November 4, 4:10 pm:
* Created and ran the second test for all arithmetic I type instructions
* Discovered that the slti and sltiu were incorrect, then we fixed the problem we had with the carry flag, which was leading to this problem.
* Discovered that the >>>operator was working incorrectly as it was not sign extending. We then added $signed() around the operand to ensure that the program is taking signed numbers into account.
November 4, 6:30 pm(A break was taken after this):
* Created and ran the third test for all Load and R type instructions. It worked on the first try :) 
November 4, 8:25 pm:
* Created and ran the fourth test for the rest of the instructions including the SBUJ type instructions as well as JALR, EBREAK, ECALL, FENCE, FENCE.I. 
* Discovered problems in AUIPC and JALR instructions and fixed them.
November 4, 9:30 pm:
* Attempted a functional program that writes 1,2,3,4,5 into memory and swaps it to 5,4,3,2,1.
November 4, 9:59 pm:
*  left the lab


Sunday:
November 5, 5:00pm: 
* Wrote the report and readme.txt
